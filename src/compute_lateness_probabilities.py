def compute_lateness_probabilities():
    """
    Computes the probability that Rita will be late to her 09:05 meeting based on 
    her home departure time.

    Assumes:
    - Rita takes exactly 5 minutes (300 seconds) to walk from home to the Zoo bus stop.
    - She will catch the first available bus (bus_1, bus_2, or bus_3) that arrives at or after she arrives.
    - She is late if the bus she catches arrives at Toompark later than 09:01:00.

    The function simulates departure times from 07:50:00 to 09:10:00 (inclusive), in 1-second increments.

    Returns:
        List[Tuple[str, float]]: A list of (time_str, P_late) pairs, where:
            - time_str (str): The time Rita leaves home in "HH:MM:SS" format.
            - P_late (float): The estimated probability that she arrives late.
